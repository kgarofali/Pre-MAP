## ASTR 192: Research Projects Autumn 2015

Below are descriptions of the possible research projects you will work on this quarter. You can find a PDF version [here](link). The advisers listed below will present their projects for 5-10 minutes in class on Friday, October 9th. As part of Writing Assignment 2, you will rank the three projects you find most interesting, explain why they interest you in a couple of sentences, and let me know via email (garofali [at] uw [dot] edu) by October 11th. I will make the final project assignments, splitting you into teams of two, and let you know who your partners and mentors are in class on Monday, October 12th.

# Testing our Models for the Stuff Between Galaxies

**Advisors:** Phoebe Upton Sanderbeck and [Professor Matt McQuinn](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcquinn/Welcome.html)

**Description:** Most of the matter in the Universe lies between galaxies in the intergalactic medium.  The gas there is so diffuse that the it emits very little radiation.  The primary way to detect it is to look at very bright supermassive black holes (quasars) and look for the absorption of intervening intergalactic gas in their spectrum. This project is to investigate the properties of intergalactic gas when the Universe was two billion years old and whether it agrees with our best models.  Our best models start with a quite-educated guess for the conditions of the post-Big Bang Universe and evolve them forward in a simulation under the equations of gravity and hydrodynamics.    We will be looking at a diagnostic of intergalactic gas that has not been carefully compared against cosmological simulations, namely the number of regions that have density ten times or so the cosmic mean density, to test our models for the intergalactic medium.

**Project Skills:** python (numpy and matplotlib libraries); elementary probability theory (Poissonian statistics and chi^2 statistic—both are much simpler than they sound and no previous knowledge of them is necessary).

# Project Tricycle: Spotting Stars that Wheel and Spin

**Advisors**: [John Lurie](http://staff.washington.edu/lurie/), [Professor Suzanne Hawley](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/slh/), and [Kolby Weisenberger](http://staff.washington.edu/kweis/)

**Description:** Stars are the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. They emit enormous amounts of energy and produce all of the elements beyond hydrogen and helium, not to mention hosting planets. Determining the fundamental properties of stars — such as their masses, diameters and ages — is a major goal for astronomers. An eclipsing binary is a system of two stars that orbit each other, periodically passing in front of one another as seen from the Earth.The special nature of such systems allows us to determine the stars’ masses and diameters. Furthermore, many stars have spots like those on the Sun. From the spots we can measure how fast the stars are rotating, which tells us about their ages and magnetic fields. 

Students will analyze data from the Kepler spacecraft, looking for systems with three distinct cycles, or periods: one due to the binary orbit, and two more due to the rotation of spots on each star. Students will also produce simulations to better understand what types of systems can be detected. Ultimately, the results will help expand our understanding of how stars work.

**Project Skills:** Basic familiarity with core Python packages, e.g. NumPy, matplotlib. Can commit changes to code with git and push to GitHub

# Supernova Cosmology 

**Advisors:** Lisa McBride and Dr. Rahul Biswas 

**Description:** We now know that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to the presence of dark energy. In order to better understand the nature of dark energy we will explore the effects that different expansion histories of the universe have on various observables. Here, we will work on some of key steps in supernova cosmology, where the intensity of light from supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), which are exploding stars of a specific kind, are recorded as a function of time (called light curves) and used to constrain models of cosmic expansion history.

Usually, supernova cosmology involves characterizing supernova light curves in terms of emperical models, and using these to constrain cosmic expansion. This project will involve studying characterization of such light curves mostly using a python based code called SNCosmo (http://sncosmo.github.io), and simulated data for the LSST (http://www.lsst.org/), a survey in which the UW astronomy department is deeply engaged in. A major difference between current and future large surveys and older supernova surveys is that the newer surveys will have too many supernovae to follow-up spectroscopically. This study can assess some aspects (like determination of redshift) of the impact of this difference for LSST.

**Project Skills:** The project mostly involves coding in python, simulating and running analyses on large numbers of supernovae by building on code blocks (will be provided) for individual tasks.

**Advisor:** [Dr. Breanna Binder](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/bbinder/personal.html)

**Description:** The late stages of very massive star evolution can be profoundly affected
by interactions with the surrounding interstellar medium or with a binary companion. 
During a supernova explosion, the ejected material can slam into the dense 
circumstellar material and shock heat the gas to very high temperatures. Alternatively, 
some massive stars undergo giant eruptions during the late stages of their evolution 
(eta Carina is a famous example in the Milky Way), and it has recently been suggested 
that interactions with a binary companion may be an important driver for trigger these 
enormous outbursts. These major eruptions can sometimes be mistaken for 
supernovae, earning this class of object the name “supernova impostors.” In this 
project, you will search for X-ray emission from supernovae and supernova impostors 
using archival observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The goal of this 
project is to find the fraction of these events that have associated X-ray emission, and to 
search for correlations between X-ray emission and the properties of the progenitor star 
and its environment.

**Project Skills:** UNIX and Python for making plots. Students will also learn how to
obtain and analyze data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory using CIAO, with instructor help.

# APO 3.5m Dome Flow Analysis

**Advisor:** Joseph Huehnerhoff

**Description:** Cooling of large telescopes directly affects the quality of the science obtained.Anemometer stations have been placed around the dome of the 3.5m telescope at 
Apache Point Observatory to characterize the movement of air in the dome.  This 
project will be to analyze this data in a manner that will allow for understanding of 
how the dome behaves under typical observing conditions.  

The tricky part of the data is that that it is taken at a relatively high cadence over 
long periods of time.  The anemometer stations were also moved around the dome, 
so the data must be combined to obtain a complete set.

**Project Skills:** Terminal, VI and / or EMACS, Python (File IO, matplotlib)

# Super-massive Black Holes and Galaxy Properties

<img src="../images/tom.jpg" width="500px" height="500px">

**Advisors:** [Professor Tom Quinn](http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/faculty/trq/) and [Michael Tremmel](http://staff.washington.edu/mjt29/)

**Description:** From our own Milky Way to large galaxies at the centers of clusters, it appears that all galaxies host at least one large black hole at their center.  While we call these central black holes ``Super-massive'', they are quite small compared to the galaxy as a whole.  Therefore the question arises: what effects can these black holes have on the overall properties of the galaxy?  Black holes are presumed to power the jets (see image) and Active Galactic Nuclei which are energetic enough to influence the gas in entire galaxy and beyond, but what is the overall effect on the size and shape of the host galaxy? One way to answer this question is to simulate the physics of this process in computer models of a large number of galaxies, and correlate the properties of the black holes with the properties of the galaxies that host them.

In this project, you will be exploring data from a computer model run
on one of the largest supercomputers in the country, where a patch of
the Universe containing hundreds of galaxies has been simulated.  You
will use web-based and graphical tools to explore these galaxies,
identify the ones with large or active black holes, and discover the
correlations between the black hole properties and the properties of
the galaxies.

**Project Skills:** python/numpy/pylab
